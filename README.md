#Setup instructions:
Make sure you have cocos2d installed. This application is built on top of 3.9, get it on http://cocos2d-x.org/download.

Create a new project in a random directory with:
cocos new projectName -l js

copy the /frameworks directory to the mapswipe directory (it is so large that we had to ignore it in git)

Enter your project directory and run:
cocos run -p web
